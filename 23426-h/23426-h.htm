<h1>THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH</h1>


<p class="center">By JIM HARMON</p>

<h2>I</h2>


<p class="new-chapter">Sam Collins flashed the undertaker
a healthy smile,
hoping it wouldn't depress
old Candle too much. He saluted.
The skeletal figure in
endless black nodded gravely,
and took hold of Sam Collins'
arm with a death grip.</p>

<p>"I'm going to bury you,
Sam Collins," the undertaker
said.</p>

<p>The tall false fronts of
Main Street spilled out a lake
of shadow, a canal of liquid
heat that soaked through the
iron weave of Collins' jeans
and turned into black ink
stains. The old window of the
hardware store showed its
age in soft wrinkles, ripples
that had caught on fire in the
sunset. Collins felt the twilight
stealing under the arms
of his tee-shirt. The overdue
hair on the back of his rangy
neck stood up in attention.
It was a joke, but the first
one Collins had ever known
Doc Candle to make.</p>

<p>"In time, I guess you'll
bury me all right, Doc."</p>

<p>"In my time, not yours,
Earthling."</p>

<p>"Earthling?" Collins repeated
the last word.</p>

<p>The old man frowned. His
face was a collection of lines.
When he frowned, all the
lines pointed to hell, the
grave, decay and damnation.</p>

<p>"Earthling," the undertaker
repeated. "Earthman? Terrestrial?
Solarian? Space
Ranger? <i>Homo sapiens?</i>"</p>

<p>Collins decided Candle was
sure in a jokey mood. "Kind
of makes you think of it,
don't it, Doc? The spaceport
going right up outside of
town. Rocketships are going
to be out there taking off for
the Satellite, the Moon, places
like that. Reminds you that
we <em>are</em> Earthlings, like they
say in the funnies, all right."</p>

<p>"Not outside town."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Inside. Inside town. Part
of the spaceship administration
building is going to go
smack in the middle of where
your house used to be."</p>

<p>"My house <em>is</em>."</p>

<p>"For less time than you will
be yourself, Earthling."</p>

<p>"Earthling yourself! What's
wrong with you, Doc?"</p>

<p>"No. I am not an Earthling.
I am a superhuman alien from
outer space. My mission on
Earth is to destroy you."</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Collins pulled away gently.
When you lived in a
town all your life and knew its
people, it wasn't unusual to
see some old person snap under
the weight of years.</p>

<p>"You have to destroy the
rocketship station, huh, Doc,
before it sends up spaceships?"</p>

<p>"No. I want to kill <em>you</em>.
That is my mission."</p>

<p>"<em>Why?</em>"</p>

<p>"Because," Candle said, "I
am a basically evil entity."</p>

<p>The undertaker turned
away and went skittering
down Main Street, his lopsided
gait limping, sliding,
hopping, skipping, at a refined
leisurely pace. He was
a collection of dancing,
straight black lines.</p>

<p>Collins stared after the old
man, shook his head and forgot
about him.</p>

<p>He moved into the hardware
store. The bell tinkled
behind him. The store was
cramped with shadows and the
smell of wood and iron. It
was lined off as precisely as
a checkerboard, with counters,
drawers, compartments.</p>

<p>Ed Michaels sat behind the
counter, smoking a pipe. He
was a handsome man, looking
young in the uncertain light,
even at fifty.</p>

<p>"Hi, Ed. You closed?"</p>

<p>"Guess not, Sam. What are
you looking for?"</p>

<p>"A pound of tenpenny
nails."</p>

<p>Michaels stood up.</p>

<p>Sarah Comstock waddled
energetically out of the back.
Her sweet, angelic face lit up
with a smile. "Sam Collins.
Well, I guess <em>you'll</em> want to
help us murder them."</p>

<p>"Murder?" Collins repeated.
"Who?"</p>

<p>"Those Air Force men who
want to come in here and
cause all the trouble."</p>

<p>"How are you going to
murder them, Mrs. Comstock?"</p>

<p>"When they see our petition
in Washington, D.C.,
they'll call those men back
pretty quick."</p>

<p>"Oh," Collins said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Comstock produced
the scroll from her voluminous
handbag. "You want to
sign, don't you? They're going
to put part of the airport
on your place. They'll tear
down your house."</p>

<p>"They can't tear it down. I
won't sell."</p>

<p>"You know government
men. They'll just <em>take</em> it and
give you some money for it.
Sign right there at the top of
the new column, Sam."</p>

<p>Collins shook his head. "I
don't believe in signing
things. They can't take what's
mine."</p>

<p>"But Sam, dear, they <em>will</em>.
They'll come in and push
your house down with those
big tractors of theirs. They'll
bury it in concrete and set off
those guided missiles of theirs
right over it."</p>

<p>"They can't make me get
out," Sam said.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Ed Michaels scooped up a
pound, one ounce of nails
and spilled them onto his
scale. He pinched off the excess,
then dropped it back in
and fed the nails into a brown
paper bag. He crumpled the
top and set it on the counter.
"That's twenty-nine plus one,
Sam. Thirty cents."</p>

<p>Collins laid out a quarter
and a nickel and picked up
the bag. "Appreciate you doing
this after store hours,
Ed."</p>

<p>Michaels chuckled. "I
wasn't exactly getting ready
for the opera, Sam."</p>

<p>Collins turned around and
saw Sarah Comstock still
waiting, the petition in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Now what's a pretty girl
like you doing, wasting her
time in politics?" Collins
heard himself ask.</p>

<p>Mrs. Comstock twittered.
"I'm old enough to be your
mother, Sam Collins."</p>

<p>"I like mature women."</p>

<p>Collins watched his hand
in fascination as it reached
out to touch one of Sarah
Comstock's plump cheeks,
then dropped to her shoulder
and ripped away the strap-sleeve
of her summer print
dress.</p>

<p>A plump, rosy shoulder was
revealed, splattered with
freckles.</p>

<p>Sarah Comstock put her
hands over her ears as if to
keep from hearing her own
shrill scream. It reached out
into pure soprano range.</p>

<p>Sarah Comstock backed
away, into the shadows, and
Sam Collins followed her,
trying to explain, to apologize.</p>

<p>"Sam! <em>Sam!</em>"</p>

<p>The voice cut through to
him and he looked up.</p>

<p>Ed Michaels had a double-barreled
shotgun aimed at
him. Mrs. Michaels' face was
looking over his shoulder in
the door to the back, her face
a sick white.</p>

<p>"You get out of here, Sam,"
Michaels said. "You get out
and don't you come back.
Ever."</p>

<p>Collins' hands moved emptily
in air. He was always
better with his hands than
words, but this time even
they seemed inexpressive.</p>

<p>He crumpled the sack of
nails in both fists, and turned
and left the hardware store.</p>



<h2>II</h2>


<p class="new-chapter">His house was still there,
sitting at the end of Elm
Street, at the end of town, on
the edge of the prairie. It
was a very old house. It was
decorated with gingerboard,
a rusted-out tin rooster-comb
running the peak of the roof
and stained glass window
transoms; and the top of the
house was joined to the
ground floor by lapped fishscales,
as though it was a
mermaid instead of a house.
The house was a golden
house. It had been painted
brown against the dust, but
the keening wind, the relentless
sun, the savage rape of
the thunderstorms, they had
all bleached the brown paint
into a shining pure gold.</p>

<p>Sam stepped inside and
leaned back against the front
door, the door of full-length
glass with a border of glass
emeralds and rubies. He
leaned back and breathed
deep.</p>

<p>The house didn't smell old.
It smelled new. It smelled
like sawdust and fresh-hewn
lumber as bright and blond
as a high school senior's
crewcut.</p>

<p>He walked across the flowered
carpet. The carpet didn't
mind footsteps or bright sun.
It never became worn or
faded. It grew brighter with
the years, the roses turning
redder, the sunflowers becoming
yellower.</p>

<p>The parlor looked the same
as it always did, clean and
waiting to be used. The cane-backed
sofa and chairs eagerly
waiting to be sat upon, the
bead-shaded kerosene lamps
ready to burst into light.</p>

<p>Sam went into his workshop.
This had once been the
ground level master bedroom,
but he had had to make the
change. The work table held
its share of radios, toasters,
TV sets, an electric train,
a spring-wind Victrola. Sam
threw the nails onto the table
and crossed the room, running
his fingers along the silent
keyboard of the player piano.
He looked out the window.
The bulldozers had made the
ground rectangular, level and
brown, turning it into a gigantic
half-cent stamp. He
remembered the mail and
raised the window and
reached down into the mailbox.
It was on this side of
the house, because only this
side was technically within
city limits.</p>

<p>As he came up with the
letters, Sam Collins saw a
man sighting along a plumbline
towards his house. He
shut the window.</p>

<p>Some of the letters didn't
have any postage stamps, just
a line of small print about a
$300 fine. Government letters.
He went over and forced
them into the tightly packed
coal stove. All the trash would
be burned out in the cold
weather.</p>

<p>Collins sat down and looked
through the rest of his mail.
A new catalogue of electronic
parts. A bulky envelope
with two paperback novels
by Richard&nbsp;S. Prather and
Robert Bloch he had ordered.
A couple of letters from
hams. He tossed the mail on
the table and leaned back.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">He thought about what
had happened in the
hardware store.</p>

<p>It wasn't surprising it had
happened to him. Things like
that were bound to happen to
him. He had just been lucky
that Ed Michaels hadn't
called the sheriff. What had
got into him? He had never
been a sex maniac before!
But still &hellip; it was hardly unexpected.</p>

<p>Might as well wait to start
on those rabbit cages until
tomorrow, he decided. This
evening he felt like exploring.</p>

<p>The house was so big, and
packed with so many things
that he never found and examined
them all. Or if he
did, he forgot a lot about the
things between times, so it
was like reading a favorite
book over again, always discovering
new things in it.</p>

<p>The parlor was red in the
fading light, and the hall beyond
the sliding doors was
deeply shadowed. In the sewing
room, he remembered, in
the drawers of the treadle
machine the radio was captured.
The rings and secret
manuals of the days when
radio had been alive. He
hadn't looked over those
things in some little time.</p>

<p>He looked up the shadowed
stairway. He remembered the
night, a few weeks before
Christmas when he had been
twelve and really too old to
believe, his mother had said
she was going up to see if
Santa Claus had left any
packages around a bit early.
They often gave him his presents
early, since they were
never quite sure he would
live until Christmas.</p>

<p>But his mother had been
playing a trick on him. She
hadn't been going up after
packages. She had gone up
those stairs to murder his
father.</p>

<p>She had shot him in the
back of the head with his
Army Colt .45 from the first
war. Collins never quite understood
why the hole in
back was so neat and the one
in front where it came out
was so messy.</p>

<p>After he went to live with
Aunt Amy and the house had
been boarded up, he heard
them talking, Aunt Amy and
her boy friend, fat Uncle
Ralph. And they had said his
mother had murdered his
father because he had gone
ahead and made her get pregnant
again and she was afraid
it would be another one like
Sam.</p>

<p>Sam Collins knew she must
have planned it a long time
in advance. She had filled up
the bathtub with milk, real
milk, and she went in after
she had done it and took a
bath in the milk. Then she
slit her wrists.</p>

<p>When Sam Collins had run
down the stairs, screaming,
and barged into the bathroom,
he had found the tub looking
like a giant stick of peppermint
candy.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Aunt Amy had been good
to him.</p>

<p>Because he didn't talk for
about a year after he found
the bodies, most people
thought he was simple-minded.
But Aunt Amy had always
treated him just like a
regular boy. That was embarrassing
sometimes, but still
it was better than what he
got from the others.</p>

<p>The doctor hadn't wanted
to perform the operation on
his clubfoot. He said it would
be an unproductive waste of
his time and talent, that he
owed it to the world to use
them to the very best advantage.
Finally he agreed. The
operation took about thirty
seconds. He stuck a knife
into Sam's foot and went
<em>snick-snick</em>. A couple of
weeks later, his foot was
healed and it was just like
anybody else's. Aunt Amy
had paid him $500 in payments,
only he returned the
money order for the last fifty
dollars and wished them
Merry Christmas.</p>

<p>Sam Collins could work
after that. When Aunty Amy
and Uncle Ralph disappeared,
he opened up the old house
and started doing odd jobs
for people who weren't very
afraid of him any more.</p>

<p>That first day had been
quite a shock, when he discovered
that not in all these
years had anybody cleaned
the bathtub.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when he was
taking his Saturday night
soaker he still got kind of a
funny feeling. But he knew
it was only rust from the
faucets.</p>

<p>Collins sighed. It seemed
like a long time since he had
seen his mother coming down
those stairs&hellip;.</p>

<p>He stopped, his throat
aching with tightness.</p>

<p>Something was very
strange.</p>

<p>His mother was coming
down the stairs right now.</p>

<p>She was walking down the
stairs, one step, two steps,
coming closer to him.</p>

<p>Collins ran up the stairs,
prepared to run through the
phantom to prove it wasn't
there.</p>

<p>The figure raised a gun
and pointed it at him.</p>

<p>This time, she was going to
shoot <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>It figured.</p>

<p>He always had bad luck.</p>

<p>"Stop!" the woman on the
stairs said. "Stop or I'll
shoot, Mr. Collins!"</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Collins stopped, catching
to the bannister. He
squinted hard, and as a stereoptic
slide lost its depth
when you shut one eye, the
woman on the stairs was no
longer his mother. She was
young, pretty, brunette and
sweet-faced, and the gun she
held shrunk from an old
Army Colt to a .22 target pistol.</p>

<p>"Who <em>are</em> you?" Collins
demanded.</p>

<p>The girl took a grip on the
gun with both hands and held
it steady on him.</p>

<p>"I'm Nancy Comstock,"
she said. "You tried to assault
my mother a half hour
ago."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said. "I've never
seen you before."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have. I've been
away to school a lot, but
you've seen me around. I've
had my eye on you. I know
about men like you. I know
what has to be done. I came
looking for you in your
house for this."</p>

<p>The bore of the gun was
level with his eye as he stood
a few steps below her. Probably
if she fired now, she
would kill him. Or more likely
he would only be blinded
or paralyzed; that was about
his luck.</p>

<p>"Are you going to use
that gun?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not unless I have to. I
only brought it along for protection.
I came to help you,
Mr. Collins."</p>

<p>"Help me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Collins. You're
sick. You need help."</p>

<p>He looked the girl over.
She was a half-dozen years
younger than he was. In most
states, she couldn't even vote
yet. But still, maybe she
could help, at that. He didn't
know much about girls and
their abilities.</p>

<p>"Why don't we go into the
kitchen and have some coffee?"
Collins suggested.</p>



<h2>III</h2>


<p class="new-chapter">Nancy sipped her coffee
and kept her eyes on his.
The gun lay in her lap. The
big kitchen was a place for
coffee, brown and black, wood
ceiling and iron stove and
pans. Collins sat across the
twelve square feet of table
from her, and nursed the
smoking mug.</p>

<p>"Sam, I want you to take
whatever comfort you can
from the fact that I don't
think the same thing about
you as the rest of Waraxe."</p>

<p>"What does the rest of the
town think about me?"</p>

<p>"They think you are a
pathological degenerate who
should be lynched. But I
don't believe that."</p>

<p>"Thanks. That's a big comfort."</p>

<p>"I know what you were after
when you tore Mom's
dress."</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Collins
felt his face warming in a
blush.</p>

<p>"You were only seeking the
mother love you missed as a
boy," the girl said.</p>

<p>Collins chewed on his lip a
moment, and considered the
idea. Slowly he shook his
head.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "No. I don't
think so."</p>

<p>"Then what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think old Doc Candle
<em>made</em> me do it. He said he
was going to bury me. Getting
me lynched would be
one good way to do it. Ed
Michaels almost blew my
head off with his shotgun. It
was close. Doc Candle almost
made it. He didn't miss by
far with you and that target
pistol either."</p>

<p>"Sam&mdash;I may call you
'Sam'?&mdash;just try to think
calmly and reasonably for a
minute. How could Dr. Candle,
the undertaker, possibly
make you do a thing like you
did in Mr. Michaels' hardware
store?"</p>

<p>"Well &hellip; he <em>said</em> he was a
superhuman alien from outer
space."</p>

<p>"If he said that, do you believe
him, Sam?"</p>

<p>"<em>Something</em> made me do
that. It just wasn't my own
idea."</p>

<p>"It's easier that way, isn't
it, Sam?" Nancy asked. "It's
easy to say. 'It wasn't me;
some space monster made me
do it.' But you really know
better, don't you, Sam? Don't
take the easy way out! You'll
only get deeper and deeper
into your makebelieve world.
It will be like quicksand. Admit
your mistakes&mdash;face up
to them&mdash;<em>lick them</em>."</p>

<p>Collins stood up, and came
around the end of the table.</p>

<p>"You're too pretty to be so
serious all the time," he said.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">"Sam, I want to help you.
Please don't spoil it by
misinterpreting my intentions."</p>

<p>"You should get a little
fun out of life," Collins listened
to himself say.</p>

<p>He came on around the big
table towards her.</p>

<p>The first time he hadn't
realized what was happening,
but this time he knew. Somebody
was pulling strings and
making him jump. He had as
much control as Charlie McCarthy.</p>

<p>"Don't come any closer,
Sam."</p>

<p>Nancy managed to keep
her voice steady, but he could
tell she was frightened.</p>

<p>He took another step.</p>

<p>She threw her coffee in his
face.</p>

<p>The liquid was only lukewarm
but the sudden dash
had given him some awareness
of his own body again,
like the first sound of the
alarm faintly pressing through
deep layers of sleep.</p>

<p>"Sam, Sam, <em>please</em> don't
make me do it! Please, Sam,
<em>don't</em>!"</p>

<p>Nancy had the gun in her
hand, rising from her chair.</p>

<p>His hands wanted to grab
her clothes and <em>tear</em>.</p>

<p>But that's <em>suicide</em>, he
screamed at his body.</p>

<p>As his hand went up with
the intention of ripping, he
deflected it just enough to
shove the barrel of the gun
away from him.</p>

<p>The shot went off, but he
knew instantly that it had
not hit him.</p>

<p>The gun fell to the floor,
and with its fall, something
else dropped away and he was
in command of himself again.</p>

<p>Nancy sighed, and slumped
against him, the left side of
her breast suddenly glossy
with blood.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Ed Michaels stared at him.
Both eyes unblinking, just
staring at <em>him</em>. He had only
taken one look at the girl
lying on the floor, blood all
over her chest. He hadn't
looked back.</p>

<p>"I didn't know who else to
call, Ed." Collins said. "Sheriff
Thurston being out of
town and all."</p>

<p>"It's okay, Sam. Mike
swore me in as a special
deputy a couple years back.
The badge is at the store."</p>

<p>"They'll hang me for this,
won't they, Ed?"</p>

<p>Michaels put his hand on
Collins' shoulder. "No, they
won't do that to you, boy. We
know you around here. They'll
just put you away for a
while."</p>

<p>"The asylum at Hannah,
huh?"</p>

<p>"Damn it, yes! What did
you expect? A marksman
medal?"</p>

<p>"Okay, Ed, okay. Did you
call Doc Van der Lies like
I told you when I phoned?"</p>

<p>Michaels took a folded
white handkerchief from his
pocket and wiped his square-jawed
face. "You sure are
taking this calm, Sam. I'm
telling you, Sam, it would
look better for you if you at
least <em>acted</em> like you were sorry&hellip;. Doc
Van der Lies is up
in Wisconsin with Mike. I
called Doc Candle."</p>

<p>"He's an undertaker," Collins
whispered.</p>

<p>"Don't you expect we need
one?" Michaels asked. Then
as if he wasn't sure of the
answer to his own question,
he said, "Did you examine
her to see if she was dead?
I&mdash;I don't know much about
women. I wouldn't be able to
tell."</p>

<p>It didn't sound like a very
good excuse to Collins.</p>

<p>"I guess she's dead," Collins
said. "That's the way he
must have wanted it."</p>

<p>"<em>He?</em> Wait a minute, Sam.
You mean you've got one of
those split personalities like
that girl on TV the other
night? There's somebody else
inside you that takes over and
makes you do things?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of it just
like that before. I guess that's
one way to look at it."</p>

<p>The knock shook the back
door before Michaels could
say anything. The door
opened and Doc Candle slithered
in disjointedly, a rolled-up
stretcher over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hello, boys," Candle said.
"A terrible accident, it brings
sorrow to us all. Poor Nancy.
Has the family been notified?"</p>

<p>"Good gosh, I forgot about
it," Michaels said. "But maybe
we better wait until you
get her&mdash;arranged, huh, Doc?"</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">"Quite so." The old man
laid the canvas stretcher
out beside the girl on
the floor and unrolled it. He
flipped the body over expertly
like a window demonstrator
flipping a pancake over
on a griddle.</p>

<p>"Ed, if you'd just take the
front, I'll carry the rear. My
vehicle is in the alley."</p>

<p>"Sam, you carry that end
for Doc. You're a few years
younger."</p>

<p>Collins wanted to say that
he couldn't, but he didn't
have enough yet to argue
with. He picked up the
stretcher and looked down at
the white feet in the Scotch
plaid slippers.</p>

<p>Candle opened the door and
waited for them to go
through.</p>

<p>The girl on the stretcher
parted her lips and rolled her
head back and forth, a puzzled
expression of pain on her
face.</p>

<p>Collins nearly dropped the
stretcher, but he made himself
hold on tight.</p>

<p>"Ed! Doc! She moved!
She's still <em>alive</em>."</p>

<p>"Cut that out now, Sam,"
Ed Michaels snapped. "Just
carry your end."</p>

<p>"She's alive," Collins insisted.
"She moved again.
Just turn around and take a
look, Ed. That's all I ask."</p>

<p>"I hefted this thing once,
and that's enough. You <em>move</em>,
Sam. I've got a .38 in my belt,
and I went to Rome, Italy,
for the Olympics about the
time you were getting yourself
born, Sam. I ought to be
able to hit a target as big as
you. Just go ahead and do as
you're told."</p>

<p>Collins turned desperately
towards Candle. Maybe Nancy
had been right, maybe he
had been imagining things.</p>

<p>"Doc, you take a look at
her," Collins begged.</p>

<p>The old man vibrated over
to the stretcher and looked
down. The girl twisted in
pain, throwing her head back,
spilling her hair over the
head of the stretcher.</p>

<p>"Rigor mortis," Doc Candle
diagnosed, with a wink to
Collins.</p>

<p>"No, Doc! She needs a doctor,
blood transfusions&hellip;."</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">"Nonsense," Candle
snapped. "I'll take her
in my black wagon up to my
place, put her in the tiled
basement. I'll pump out all
her blood and flush it down
the commode. Then I'll feed
in Formaldi-Forever Number
Zero. Formaldi-Forever, for
the Blush of Death. 'When
you think of a Pretty Girl,
think of Formaldi-Forever,
the Way to Preserve that
Beauty.' Then I'll take a
needle and some silk thread
and just a few stitches on
the eyelids and around the
mouth&hellip;."</p>

<p>"Doc, will you&hellip;?" Michaels
said faintly.</p>

<p>"Of course. I just wanted
to show Sam how foolish he
was in saying the Beloved
was still alive."</p>

<p>Nancy kicked one leg off
the stretcher and Candle
picked it up and tucked it
back in.</p>

<p>"Ed, if you'd just turn
around and <em>look</em>." Collins
said.</p>

<p>"I don't want to have to
look at your face, you murdering
son. You make me,
you say one more word, and
I'll turn around and shoot
you between the eyes."</p>

<p>Doc Candle nodded. Collins
knew then that Michaels
really would shoot him in
the head if he said anything
more, so he kept quiet.</p>

<p>Candle held the door. They
managed to get the stretcher
down the back steps, and
right into the black panel
truck. They fitted the stretcher
into the special sockets
for it, and Doc Candle closed
the double doors and slapped
his dry palm down on the
sealing crevice.</p>

<p>Instantly, there was an answering
knock from inside the
truck, a dull echo.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">"Didn't you hear that?"
Collins asked.</p>

<p>"Hear what?" Michaels
said.</p>

<p>"What are you hearing
now, Sam?" Candle inquired
solicitously.</p>

<p>"Oh. Sure," Michaels said.
"Kind of a <em>voice</em>, wasn't it,
Sam? Didn't understand what
it said. Wasn't listening too
close, not like you."</p>

<p><em>Thud-thud-thump-thud.</em></p>

<p>"No voice," Collins whispered.
"That infernal sound,
don't you hear it, Ed?"</p>

<p>"I must hurry along," the
undertaker said. "Must get
ready to work on Nancy, get
her ready for her parents to
see."</p>

<p>"All right, Doc. I'll take
care of Sam."</p>

<p>"Where you going to jail
me, Ed?" Collins asked, his
eyes on the closed truck
doors. "In your storeroom
like you did Hank Petrie?"</p>

<p>Michaels' face suddenly began
to work. "Jail? Jail you?
Jail's too good for you. Doc,
have you got a tow rope in
that truck?"</p>

<p>Ed Michaels was the best
shot in town, probably one
of the best marksmen in the
world. He had been in the
Olympics about thirty years
ago. He was Waraxe's one
claim to fame. But he wasn't
a cowboy. He wasn't a fast
draw.</p>

<p>Collins put all of his
weight behind his left fist
and landed it on the point of
Michaels' jaw, just the way
boys jumped onto him.</p>

<div style="margin: 2em auto 2em auto; width: 427px;">
<img src="images/illustration.png" width="427" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Michaels sprawled out,
spread-eagled.</p>

<p>Then Collins wanted to
take the revolver out of Ed's
belt, and press it into Ed's
hand, curling his fingers
around the grip and over the
trigger, and then he wanted
to shake Ed awake, slap his
face and shake him&hellip;.</p>

<p>Collins spun around, clawed
open the door to the truck
cab and threw himself behind
the steering wheel.</p>

<p>He stopped wanting to
make Ed Michaels shoot him.</p>

<p>He flipped the ignition
switch, levered the floor shift
and drove away.</p>

<p>And he was going to drive
on and on and on and on.</p>

<p>And on and on and on.</p>



<h2>IV</h2>


<p class="new-chapter">Collins turned onto the
old McHenty blacktop, his
foot pressed to the floorboards.
Ed Michaels didn't
own a car; he would have to
borrow one from somebody.
That would take time. Maybe
Candle would give him his
hearse to use to follow the
Black Rachel.</p>

<p>Trees, fences, barns whizzed
past the windows of the
cab and then the steel link-mesh
fence took up, the fence
surrounding the New Kansas
National Spaceport. Behind
it, further from town, some
of the concrete had been
poured and the horizon was a
remote, sterile gray sweep.</p>

<p>The McHenty Road would
soon be closed to civilian
traffic. But right now
the government wanted people
to drive along and see that
the spaceship was nothing
terrible, nothing to fear.</p>

<p>The girl, Nancy Comstock,
was alive in the back. He
knew that. But he couldn't
stop to prove it or to help
her. Candle would make them
lynch him first.</p>

<p>Why hadn't Candle stopped
him from getting away?</p>

<p>He had managed to break
his control for a second. He
had done that before when
he deflected Nancy's aim.
But he couldn't resist Candle
for long. Why hadn't Candle
made him turn around and
come back?</p>

<p>Candle's control of him had
seemed to stop when he got
inside the cab of the truck.
Could it be that the metal
shield of the cab could protect
an Earthling from the
strange mental powers of the
creature from another planet
which was inhabiting the
body of Doc Candle?</p>

<p>Collins shook his head.</p>

<p>More likely Candle was doing
this just to get his hopes
up. He probably would seize
control of him any time he
wanted to. But Collins decided
to go on playing it as if
he did have some hope, as if
a shield of metal could protect
him from Candle's control.
Otherwise &hellip; there was
no otherwise.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Collins suddenly saw an
opening.</p>

<p>The steel mesh fence was
ruptured by a huge semitrailer
truck turned on its
side. Twenty feet of fence on
either side was down. This
was restricted government
property, but of course spaceships
were hardly prime military
secrets any longer. Repairs
in the fence had not
been made instantaneously,
and the wreckage was not
guarded.</p>

<p>Collins swerved the wheel
and drove the old wagon
across the waffle-plate obstruction,
onto the smooth
tarmac beyond.</p>

<p>He raced, raced, raced
through the falling night, not
sure where he was headed.</p>

<p>Up above he saw the shelter
of shadows from a cluster
of half-finished buildings. He
drove into them and parked.</p>

<p>Collins sat still for a moment,
then threw open the
door and ran around to the
back of the truck, jerking
open the handles.</p>

<p>Nancy fell out into his
arms.</p>

<p>"What kind of ambulance
is this?" she demanded. "It
doesn't look like an ambulance.
It doesn't smell like an
ambulance. It looks like&mdash;looks
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Collins said, "Shut up. Get
out of there. We've got to
hide."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"They think I murdered
you."</p>

<p>"Murdered me? But I'm
alive. Can't they see I'm
alive?"</p>

<p>Collins shook his head. "I
doubt it. I don't know why,
but I don't think it would be
that simple. Come with me."</p>

<p>The blood on her breast
had dried, and he could see
it was only a shallow groove
dug by the bullet. But she
flinched in pain as she began
to walk, pulling the muscles.</p>

<p>They stopped and leaned
against a half-finished metallic
shed.</p>

<p>"Where are we? Where are
you taking me?"</p>

<p>"This is the spaceport. Now
shut up."</p>

<p>"Let me go."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I'm not dead," Nancy insisted.
"You know I'm not
dead. I won't press charges
against you&mdash;just let me go
free."</p>

<p>"I told you it wasn't that
simple. He wants them to
think you're dead, and that's
what they'll think."</p>

<p>Nancy passed fingers
across her eyes. "Who? Who
are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Doc Candle. He won't let
them know you're alive."</p>

<p>Nancy rubbed her forehead
with both hands. "Sam, you
don't know what you're doing.
You don't&mdash;know what
you're getting yourself into.
Just let me show myself to
someone. They'll know I'm
not dead. Really they will."</p>

<p>"Okay," he said. "Let's find
somebody."</p>

<p>He led her toward a more
nearly completed building,
showing rectangles of
light. They looked through
the windows to see several
men in uniforms bending over
blueprints on a desk jury-rigged
of sawhorses and
planks.</p>

<p>"Sam," Nancy said, "one of
those men is Terry Elston.
He's a Waraxe boy. I went to
school with him. He'll know
me. Let's go in&hellip;."</p>

<p>"No," Collins said. "We
don't go in."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Nancy started to
protest, but stopped. "Wait.
He's coming out."</p>

<p>Collins slid along the wall
and stood behind the door.
"Tell him who you are when
he comes out. I'll stay here."</p>

<p>They waited. After a few
seconds, the door opened.</p>

<p>Nancy stepped into the rectangle
of light thrown on the
concrete from the window.</p>

<p>"Terry," she said. "Terry,
it's me&mdash;Nancy Comstock."</p>

<p>The blue-jawed young man
in uniform frowned. "Who
did you say you were? Have
you got clearance from this
area?"</p>

<p>"It's me, Terry. Nancy.
Nancy Comstock."</p>

<p>Terry Elston stepped front
and center. "That's not a very
good joke. I knew Nancy.
Hell of a way to die, killed
by some maniac."</p>

<p>"Terry, <em>I'm</em> Nancy. Don't
you recognize me?"</p>

<p>Elston squinted. "You look
familiar. You look a little like
Nancy. But you can't be her,
because she's dead."</p>

<p>"I'm here, and I tell you
I'm <em>not</em> dead."</p>

<p>"Nancy's dead," Elston repeated
mechanically. "Say,
what are you trying to pull?"</p>

<p>"Terry, behind you. A maniac!"</p>

<p>"Sure," Elston said. "Sure.
There's a maniac <em>behind</em> me."</p>

<p>Collins stepped forward
and hit Elston behind the ear.
He fell silently.</p>

<p>Nancy stared down at him.</p>

<p>"He refused to recognize
me. He acted like I was crazy,
pretending to be Nancy Comstock."</p>

<p>"Come on along," Collins
urged. "They'll probably
shoot us on sight as trespassers."</p>

<p>She looked around herself
without comprehension.</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"<em>This way.</em>"</p>

<p>Collins did not say those
words.</p>

<p>They were said by the man
with the gun in the uniform
like the one worn by Elston.
He motioned impatiently.</p>

<p>"This way, this way."</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">"No priority," Colonel
Smith-Boerke said as
he paced back and forth, gun
in hand.</p>

<p>From time to time he
waved it threateningly at Collins
and Nancy who sat on
the couch in Smith-Boerke's
office. They had been sitting
for close to two hours. Collins
now knew the Colonel
did not intend to turn him
over to the authorities. They
were being held for reasons
of Smith-Boerke's own.</p>

<p>"They sneak the ship in
here, plan for an unscheduled
hop from an uncompleted
base&mdash;the strictest security
we've used in ten or fifteen
years&mdash;and now they cancel
it. This is bound to get
leaked by somebody! They'll
call it off. It'll never fly
now."</p>

<p>Collins sat quietly. He had
been listening to this all evening.
Smith-Boerke had been
drinking, although it wasn't
very obvious.</p>

<p>Smith-Boerke turned to
Collins.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for
somebody like you. Just
waiting for you to come
along. And here you are, a
wanted fugitive, completely
in my power! Perfect, <em>perfect</em>."</p>

<p>Collins nodded to himself.
Of course, Colonel Smith-Boerke
had been waiting for
him. And Doc Candle had
driven him right to him. It
was inescapable. He had been
intended to escape and turn
up right here all along.</p>

<p>"What do you want with
me?"</p>

<p>Smith-Boerke's flushed
face brightened. "You want
to become a hero? A hero so
big that all these trumped-up
charges against you will be
dropped? It'll be romantic.
Back to Lindbergh-to-Paris.
Tell me, Collins, how would
you like to be the first man
to travel faster than light?"</p>

<p>Collins knew there was no
way out.</p>

<p>"All right," he said.</p>

<p>Smith-Boerke wiped a
hand across his dry mouth.</p>

<p>"Project Silver <em>has</em> to come
off. My whole career depends
on it. You don't have anything
to do. Everything's cybernetic.
Just ride along and
prove a human being can survive.
Nothing to it. No hyperdrives,
none of that kind of
stuff. We had an engine that
could go half lightspeed and
now we've made it twice as
efficient and more. No superstitions
about Einstein, I
hope? No? Good."</p>

<p>"I'll go," Collins said. "But
what if I had said 'no'."</p>

<p>Smith-Boerke put the gun
away in a desk drawer.</p>

<p>"Then you could have
walked out of here, straight
into the MP's."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they come in
here after me?"</p>

<p>"They don't have security
clearance for this building."</p>

<p>"<em>Don't</em> leave me alone,"
Nancy said urgently. "I don't
understand what's happening.
I feel so helpless. I need
help."</p>

<p>"You're asking the wrong
man," Collins said briefly.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Collins felt safe when
the airlock kissed shut its
metal lips.</p>

<p>It was not like the house,
but yet he felt safe, surrounded
by all the complicated,
expensive electronic
equipment. It was big, solid,
sterilely gleaming.</p>

<p>Another thing&mdash;he had reason
to believe that Doc Candle's
power could not reach
him through metal.</p>

<p>"But I'm not outside," Doc
Candle said, "I'm in here,
with you."</p>

<p>Collins yelled and cursed,
he tried to pull off the acceleration
webbing and claw
through the airlock. Nobody
paid any attention to him.
Count downs had been automated.
Smith-Boerke was
handling this one himself,
and he cut off the Audio-In
switch from the spaceship.
Doc Candle said nothing else
for a moment, and the spaceship,
almost an entity itself,
went on with its work.</p>

<p>The faster-than-light spaceship
took off.</p>

<p>At first it was like any
other rocket takeoff.</p>

<p>The glow of its exhaust
spread over the field of the
spaceport, then over the hills
and valleys, and then the
town of Waraxe, spreading
illumination even as far as
Sam Collins' silent house.</p>

<p>After a time of being sick,
Collins lay back and accepted
this too.</p>

<p>"That's right, that's it,"
Doc Candle said. "Take it
and die with it. That's the
ticket."</p>

<p>Collins' eyes settled on a
gauge. Three quarters lightspeed.
Climbing.</p>

<p>Nothing strange, nothing
untoward happened when you
reached lightspeed. It was
only an arbitrary number. All
else was superstition. Forget
it, forget it, forget it.</p>

<p><em>Something</em> was telling him
that. At first he thought it
was Doc Candle but then he
knew it was the ship.</p>

<p>Collins sat back and took it,
and what he was taking was
death. It was creeping over
him, seeping into his feet,
filling him like liquid does
a sponge.</p>

<p>Not will, but curiosity,
caused him to turn his head.</p>

<p>He saw Doc Candle.</p>

<p>The old body was dying.
He was in the emergency
seat, broken, a ribbon of
blood lacing his chin. But
Doc Candle continued to
laugh triumphantly in Collins'
head.</p>

<p>"Why? Why do you have
to kill me?" Collins asked.</p>

<p>"Because I am evil."</p>

<p>"How do you know you're
evil?"</p>

<p>"<em>They told me so!</em>" Candle
shouted back in the thundering
silence of Death's
approach. "They were always
saying I was bad."</p>

<p><em>They.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">Collins got a picture of
something incredibly old
and incredibly wise, but long
unused to the young, clumsy
gods. Something that could
mar the molding of a godling
and make it mortal.</p>

<p>"But I'm not really so very
bad," Doc Candle went on.
"I had to destroy, but I
picked someone who really
didn't care if he were destroyed
or not. An almost absolutely
passive human being,
Sam. You."</p>

<p>Collins nodded.</p>

<p>"And even then," said the
superhuman alien from outer
space, "I could not just destroy.
I have created a work
of art."</p>

<p>"Work of art?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have taken your
life and turned it into a horror
story, Sam! A chilling,
demonic, black-hearted horror!"</p>

<p>Collins nodded again.</p>

<p><em>LIGHTSPEED.</em></p>

<p>There was finally something
human within Sam Collins
that he could not deny.
He wanted to live. It wasn't
true. He did care what happened.</p>

<p>You do? said somebody.</p>

<p>He does? asked somebody
else, surprised, and suddenly
he again got the image of
wiser, older creatures, a little
ashamed because of what
they had done to the creature
named Doc Candle.</p>

<p>He does, chorused several
voices, and Sam Collins cried
aloud: "I do! I want to live!"
They were just touching
lightspeed; he felt it.</p>

<p>This time it was not just
a biological response. He really
wanted help. He wanted
to stay alive.</p>

<p>From the older, wiser voices
he got help, though he never
knew how; he felt the ship
move slipwise under him, and
then a crash.</p>

<p>And Doc Candle got help
too, the only help even the
older, wiser ones could give
him.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="new-section">They pulled him out of
the combined wreckage of
the spaceship and his house.
Both were demolished.</p>

<p>It was strange how the
spaceship Sam Collins was on
crashed right into his house.
Ed Michaels recalled a time
in a tornado when Sy Baxter's
car was picked up, lifted
across town and dropped
into his living room.</p>

<p>When the men from the
spaceport lifted away tons of
rubble, they found him and
said, "He's dead."</p>

<p>No, I'm not, Collins
thought. I'm alive.</p>

<p>And then they saw that he
really was alive, that he had
come through it alive somehow,
and nobody remembered
anything like it since the
airliner crash in '59.</p>

<p>A while later, after they
found Doc Candle's body and
court-martialed Smith-Boerke,
who took drugs, Nancy
was nuzzling him on his
hospital bed. It was nice,
but he wasn't paying much
attention.</p>

<p>I'm free, Collins thought as
the girl hugged him. <em>Free!</em>
He kissed her.</p>

<p>Well, he thought while she
was kissing him back, as
free as I want to be, anyway.</p>
